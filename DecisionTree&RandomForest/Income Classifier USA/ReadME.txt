Referring to 'IncomeClassifierUSA' notebook:

The dataset used in this project was the "Adult Data Set" present and available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult

The model used was Decision Tree & Random Forest. This model was selected because the dataset has a lot of categorical variables (Nominal and Binary Categories) that do not represent ordinality.

The model could be fully tuned through the selection of all hyperparameters in GridSearch, but this is extremely costly to the model and possibly does not offer such statistical differences in accuracy, precision, and recall.

Any suggestions,doubts, or critics, please consider sending me an email or dm:

Thank you for the attention. Please consider following my job :). I'll try to improve over the days, months and years.
